# New Features for Noise Machine
 
## Scale and Chord Mode

![Schematic for selecting scale or chord mode](Noise_Machine_Step1.png?raw=true "Step1: Select Scale or Chord Mode")
Move the slider all the way to the left and select either one of the seven modes or chord mode major or minor. 

![Schematic for selecting key](Noise_Machine_Step2.png?raw=true "Step 2: Select Key")
Select a key for scale or chord mode. Move the slider back into a middle position. When scale mode is selected Noise Machine will only play the notes that are part of this scale and skip notes that are not part of the scale. This also increases its range beyond one octave.

![Schematic for using chord mode](Noise_Machine_Chord_Mode.png?raw=true "Play with Chorod Mode - Example for minor")
When chord mode is selected, buttons 1 to 7 play the chords of the selected key as displayed with roman numerals. Buttons 8 to 12 modify the chords played when held pressed before playing a chord. 

## Midi Control Mode

Moving the slider all to the right enters Midi Control Mode. Holding one of the buttons 1 to 12 changes the midi CC for the rotary controller, e.g. holding button 5 will send the values of the rotary controller to Midi CC 5 and so on.
